# Cursor Rules vs Claude Rules Comparison

## Overview

This document compares the intelligent Cursor rules (`.mdc` files) with the Claude rules (`.md` files) that have been ported over. Both serve different but complementary purposes in the development workflow.

## Key Differences

### Cursor Rules (`.mdc` files)

**Purpose**: Automated, context-aware suggestions and actions triggered by Cursor IDE
**Location**: `.cursor/rules/` directory
**Format**: Structured with `<rule>` tags, filters, and actions
**Triggering**: Automatic based on file events, content patterns, and context

**Features**:
- âœ… **Automatic Execution**: Triggered by file operations and content changes
- âœ… **Real-time Suggestions**: Provide immediate feedback during development
- âœ… **Action Execution**: Can perform automated tasks (git commits, file operations)
- âœ… **Context Filtering**: Smart pattern matching and event detection
- âœ… **IDE Integration**: Seamlessly integrated into the Cursor development environment

### Claude Rules (`.md` files)

**Purpose**: Conversational guidance and educational content for development discussions
**Location**: `claude_rules/` directory
**Format**: Markdown documentation with structured guidelines
**Triggering**: Manual application based on conversation context

**Features**:
- âœ… **Educational Content**: Detailed explanations and reasoning
- âœ… **Conversational Context**: Applied during discussions and code reviews
- âœ… **Comprehensive Guidelines**: Extensive best practices and examples
- âœ… **Flexible Application**: Can be referenced in various contexts
- âœ… **Learning Focus**: Designed to teach and explain concepts

## Rule Comparison

### 1. Conventional Commits

#### Cursor Rule (`conventional-commits.mdc`)
```yaml
# Automatic execution
- type: execute
  when: "git_status_changed"
  command: |
    # Extract commit type and scope
    # Automatically commit with proper format
```

**Strengths**:
- Automatically detects commit type from changes
- Extracts scope from file paths
- Performs actual git commits
- Real-time suggestions during file operations

#### Claude Rule (`conventional-commits.md`)
```markdown
# Educational guidance
- Smart commit type detection based on changes
- Comprehensive examples for all commit types
- Guidelines for proper formatting
```

**Strengths**:
- Detailed explanations of commit types
- Educational examples and best practices
- Can be referenced during code reviews
- Teaches the reasoning behind conventions

### 2. Python Flask Guidelines

#### Cursor Rule (`python-flask-guidelines.mdc`)
```yaml
# Context-aware suggestions
- type: suggest
  when: "creating_new_file"
  message: "Use application factory pattern..."
- type: suggest
  when: "writing_routes"
  message: "Use Blueprint organization..."
```

**Strengths**:
- 8 different scenario-based suggestions
- Automatic detection of Flask patterns
- Real-time guidance during development
- Specific code examples for each scenario

#### Claude Rule (`python-flask-guidelines.md`)
```markdown
# Comprehensive guidelines
- Application factory pattern guidance
- Blueprint organization best practices
- Error handling with guard clauses
- Complete code examples and explanations
```

**Strengths**:
- Comprehensive educational content
- Detailed explanations of concepts
- Can be used for learning and teaching
- Flexible application in discussions

### 3. Cursor Rules Location Validation

#### Cursor Rule (Original specification)
```yaml
# Validation and enforcement
- type: reject
  conditions:
    - pattern: "^(?!\\.\\/\\.cursor\\/rules\\/.*\\.mdc$)"
      message: "Cursor rule files must be in .cursor/rules directory"
```

**Strengths**:
- Automatic validation of rule placement
- Enforcement of directory structure
- Real-time feedback on rule organization

#### Claude Rule (`cursor-rules-location.md`)
```markdown
# Guidelines and best practices
- Directory structure requirements
- File naming conventions
- Validation checklist
- Common mistakes to avoid
```

**Strengths**:
- Educational guidelines for rule creation
- Comprehensive best practices
- Can be referenced when setting up projects
- Teaches proper organization principles
